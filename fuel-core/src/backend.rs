//! Core backend traits for device-agnostic tensor operations.
//!
//! This module defines the two traits that every compute backend must implement:
//!
//! - [`BackendStorage`] — a typed buffer of tensor data that lives on a
//!   specific device. It knows its own [`DType`] and its parent
//!   [`BackendDevice`], and it carries out all tensor operations (arithmetic,
//!   reductions, contractions, memory copies, …) in terms of the backend's
//!   own primitive types and kernels.
//!
//! - [`BackendDevice`] — a handle to a physical or virtual compute device
//!   (CPU core, GPU ordinal, Metal command queue, …). It manufactures blank
//!   storage tensors (zeros, uninitialized, from host data) and manages
//!   device-level resources such as the random-number-generator seed.
//!
//! # Extension point
//!
//! These traits are the stable seam for adding new backends without modifying
//! `fuel-core`. A third-party backend crate implements both traits, wraps
//! the storage type in `Storage::Custom` / `Device::Custom`, and passes a
//! constructed `Device` to `Tensor::new` — all without forking this crate.
//! (The `Custom` variant is planned for a future release; for now the first
//! step is stabilizing the documented contracts below.)
//!
//! [`BackendStorage`]: BackendStorage
//! [`BackendDevice`]: BackendDevice
