//! # fuel-inference
//!
//! **Layer**: Inference  |  **Stability**: experimental
//!
//! Inference orchestration for the Fuel ML framework. This crate provides
//! the building blocks for running autoregressive text generation and
//! transformer inference pipelines on top of `fuel-core` and
//! `fuel-transformers`.
//!
//! ## What is here
//!
//! - **KV cache** — [`kv_cache`] re-exports and unifies all cache variants
//!   (`Cache`, `KvCache`, `RotatingKvCache`, `ConcatKvCache`, `ScatteredKvCache`)
//!   currently living in `fuel-core`.
//!   currently living in `fuel-core`.
//! - **Logits processing** — [`generation`] holds `LogitsProcessor`, `Sampling`,
//!   and all decode-time logit strategies currently living in `fuel-transformers`.
//! - **Eviction policies** — [`eviction`] provides composable KV cache eviction
//!   strategies (LRU, H2O Heavy-Hitter Oracle, weighted voting aggregation).
//! - **Prefix caching** — [`prefix_cache`] provides hash-based KV state reuse
//!   for shared prompt prefixes (system prompts, few-shot examples).
//! - **StreamingLLM** — [`streaming`] implements the sink-token + recent-window
//!   attention strategy for stable generation beyond the training context window.
//! - **Speculative decoding** — [`speculative`] implements the draft-then-verify
//!   parallel token generation algorithm for reduced decode latency.
//! - **Chunked prefill** — [`chunked_prefill`] splits long prompts into bounded
//!   chunks to reduce TTFT and allow decode interleaving.
//! - **Segmented eviction** — [`segmented_eviction`] provides span-level KV cache
//!   management where logical segments are evicted as complete units.
//! - **KV compression** — [`kv_compress`] provides three orthogonal compression
//!   strategies (KIVI quantization, R-KV importance pruning, low-rank approximation).
//! - **Scheduler** — [`scheduler`] is a memory-aware inference scheduler with
//!   priority queuing and eviction-pressure admission control.
//! - **MoE routing** — [`moe_routing`] provides capacity-aware top-K token routing
//!   for Mixture-of-Experts models.
//! - **Tiered storage** — [`tiered_storage`] tracks KV cache segments across
//!   GPU → CPU → Disk tiers with budget-aware demotion/promotion and position
//!   ID preservation for RoPE re-injection.
//! - **Context compression** — [`context_compress`] provides token-budget-aware
//!   turn selection and compression for conversations exceeding the context window.
//! - **Tool calls** — [`tool_call`] provides structured tool call parsing,
//!   validation, dispatch, and result injection for function-calling models.
//! - **Pipelines** — [`pipelines`] is placeholder for future session and
//!   batching abstractions.
//!
//! ## What is NOT here
//!
//! - Model definitions (stay in `fuel-transformers`)
//! - Training loop or gradient utilities (use `fuel-training`)
//! - Tokenisation (use `tokenizers` crate directly)
//! - Data loading (use `fuel-datasets`)
//!
//! ## Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fuel_inference::generation::{LogitsProcessor, Sampling};
//! use fuel::{Device, Tensor};
//!
//! # fn main() -> fuel::Result<()> {
//! let device = Device::Cpu;
//! let mut lp = LogitsProcessor::new(42, Some(0.7), None);
//!
//! // logits: shape [vocab_size]
//! let logits = Tensor::zeros(32_000usize, fuel::DType::F32, &device)?;
//! // let next_token = lp.sample(&logits)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Layer placement
//!
//! ```text
//! fuel-inference   ← you are here (inference orchestration)
//! fuel-transformers (model definitions)
//! fuel-core        (tensors, devices, autograd, AND the NN surface:
//!                   `lazy_nn_varbuilder::LazyVarBuilder`,
//!                   `lazy_nn_varmap::LazyVarMap`, and `lazy_nn/`
//!                   — linear, embedding, norm, activation, lora,
//!                   quantizable_linear, moe, conv, sequential)
//! ```
//!
//! Note: a separate `fuel-nn` crate is **planned, not shipped** — there is no
//! such crate in the workspace today, and the NN surface lives in `fuel-core`
//! as shown above. Extracting it is a step of the `fuel-core` retirement
//! program. (Corrected 2026-07-29: the previous layer diagram listed
//! `fuel-nn` as an existing layer, which sent a consumer looking for a crate
//! that does not exist. See `docs/architecture/02-layers.md`.)
//!
//! Nothing in `fuel-core` or `fuel-transformers` depends on
//! this crate. It is a leaf that aggregates; it does not define.

// ── Re-export inference building blocks ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `kv_cache` and `sampling` now live in `fuel-core` (no fuel-nn dep
// required here). `generation` lives in `fuel-transformers` (moving it here
// would require fuel-transformers to depend on fuel-inference, violating
// the leaf-crate principle). `fuel-inference` aggregates; it does not define.
