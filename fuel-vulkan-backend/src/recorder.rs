//! Batched command buffer recorder for VulkanBackend.
//!
//! Records ALL dispatches for a realize() pass into a SINGLE command
//! buffer with pipeline barriers between ops. Submitted once at
//! download time. Replaces the old per-op submit pattern that incurred
//! ~30µs of host overhead per dispatch × ~9K dispatches per 32-token
//! run = ~270ms of pure submit overhead.
//!
//! The batch recording uses raw Vulkan calls to keep the command
//! buffer in recording state across multiple `record_batch_dispatch`
//! calls — vulkane's RAII `CommandBufferRecording` wrapper calls
//! `vkEndCommandBuffer` on drop, which would close the recording
//! after each dispatch. The raw calls are safe because:
//! - All handles come from vulkane's safe RAII types (`.raw()`)
//! - The CB is in recording state for the entire batch
//! - Transient resources (descs, params buffers) are kept alive
//!   until the fence signals
